BlueMeastro Tempo Environment Monitor reader

Run this on a linux machine with a bluetooth interface. It will do an
bluetooth le scan every 60 seconds, and retrieve the temperature,
humidity and pressure from the result. This is will be logged to a file
/var/log/tempod/measurements.csv and you can retrieve the current values
over http. By default it will listen on port 80; you can specify a 
different value on the command line with -p 2000.
